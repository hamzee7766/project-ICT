        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Muhammad Ahmar Faisal Lakhani</p>
        <p><strong>ID Number:</strong> 34405021</p>
        <p><strong>Deployment URL:</strong> <a href="https://project-ict-blue.vercel.app" target="_blank">https://project-ict-blue.vercel.app</a></p>
        
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project aims to create a cloud-hosted web application using <strong>Vercel</strong> as the infrastructure provider. The website will serve as an informational platform for car enthusiasts, providing technical details, reviews, and recommendations on car parts. The primary goal is to offer a user-friendly and responsive interface where users can explore various automotive components, compare specifications, and make informed purchase decisions.</p>
        
        <p>The web application will be built using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>, ensuring a lightweight and interactive experience. The backend may later be expanded with <strong>Next.js and a database</strong> for dynamic content management. Hosting the project on <strong>Vercel</strong> ensures high availability, scalability, and security without the need for manual server management.</p>
        
        <p>For the cloud deployment, a <strong>Vercel-hosted instance</strong> has been provisioned, and a <strong>static website</strong> has been configured to serve the content. The server is publicly accessible through the provided deployment URL, and it will remain online for grading purposes. Future enhancements may include SSL encryption, domain name registration, and database integration.</p>
        
        <p>This project is essential in understanding <strong>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</strong> and learning about the deployment and management of cloud-hosted applications. By leveraging <strong>Vercel</strong>, this project demonstrates practical implementation skills, such as cloud-based hosting, version control integration, and continuous deployment. The insights gained from this project will be beneficial for real-world applications in <strong>cloud computing, cybersecurity, and web development</strong>.</p>
